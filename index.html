		<h1>Easy Lahmacun Recipe</h1>
		<h2>What is Lahmacun and Where is it From?</h2>
		<p>Flatbreads have been a popular thing throughout the Mediterranean for ages--from Italian pizza, to za'atar manaqish from the Levant, and Lahmacun, known as an Armenian specialty that's made it's way to Turkey.</p>
		<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>2 cups (240g) bread flour, or a combination of all-purpose and semolina flour</li>
			<li>1 ½ tsp instant yeast</li>
			<li>1 tsp light brown sugar</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
			<li>1 large egg</li>
			<li>1/2 cup (120 ml) whole milk</li>
			<li>1/4 cup (60 ml) extra virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing</li>
			
		</ul>
		<h2>How to make:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Step 1/6:<br>

				To make the dough, first, you warm the milk, ideally in a microwave on high heat for no more than 30 seconds. In a large bowl whisk together the flour, instant dry yeast, light brown sugar, and salt. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add to it one large egg, warmed milk, and extra virgin olive oil. Knead for five to six minutes until you have a smooth and elastic dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in a warm place to prove for two hours until doubled in size.
            </li>
            <li>Step 2/6:<br>
                Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into four equal portions and then shape each piece into a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Step 3/6:<br>
                While the dough is resting, place a baking tray inside the oven and set it to preheat at 250°C/480°F. To make the topping first slice the tomatoes in half, then remove the seeds and squeeze out the juice. Place all the ingredients that make the topping, except meat, in a food processor until well combined. Now, incorporate the meat and pulse until the mixture turns into a paste.
            </li>
           <li>Step 4/6:<br>
                To assemble, lightly flour a ball of dough, then roll it into a thin round. Place the round on a piece of baking paper and brush the edges with olive oil.
            </li>
            <li>Step 5/6:<br>
                Smear the topping evenly all over the dough in a thin layer, then gently press it in, taking care that you do not tear it. If the topping is falling off as you move the lahmacun, it means you need to remove some of the topping.
            </li>
            <li>Step 6/6:<br>
                Place the lahmacun with the baking paper into the baking tray and bake for five to six minutes. Repeat this last step with the remaining dough and topping.
            </li>
